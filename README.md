# System-Design-Challenge-8Weeks
A structured repository documenting my learnings from the 8-week System Design challenge by CoderArmy, featuring daily notes, diagrams, and project ideas. Covers LLD, HLD, scalability, maintainability, and real-world design patterns.

# System Design Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository for the System Design course by Coder Army! This course, organized by Aditya Tandon and hosted on the Coder Army YouTube channel, is an 8-week challenge focused on mastering System Design concepts, with C++ used as the primary language for implementation.

## Course Overview

* **Duration:** 8 Weeks (Monday to Friday, 6 PM IST)
* **Instructor:** Aditya Tandon
* **Language:** Primarily C++ (but the course is language-independent)
* **Course Content:**

  * Low-Level Design (LLD)
  * High-Level Design (HLD)
  * Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and their real-world application in System Design
  * Practical applications and real-world projects
  * Hackathons:

    * **Week 3 Hackathon** – Midway project challenge
    * **Final Hackathon** – Project-based competition at the end of the course

## Repository Content

This repository will document my learning journey, including notes, code implementations, and project-based solutions throughout the 8-week course. It will also include my takeaways and insights after each session, along with practical examples and solutions.

## Key Topics

* **Introduction to System Design**

  * Difference between DSA, LLD, and HLD
  * Understanding the importance of scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems
  * Real-world system design problems
* **Low-Level Design (LLD)**

  * Object-Oriented Design Principles
  * System Architecture and Component Design
  * Scalability, Maintainability, and Reusability
  * Plug-and-Play Design Model
* **High-Level Design (HLD)**

  * System Architecture and Technology Stack
  * Database Design, Load Balancing, Caching, and Distributed Systems
  * Application of HLD in large-scale systems
* **Real-World Projects**

  * Designing and implementing scalable applications like ride-booking apps (e.g., Uber/Ola)
  * Building systems that integrate both DSA and LLD concepts

## Hackathons

* **Week 3 Hackathon:** A challenge to apply the concepts learned so far and build a project that showcases LLD, HLD, and DSA concepts.
* **Final Hackathon:** A larger competition where participants will implement a full-fledged system, applying everything learned throughout the course.

## Repository Structure

* **Notes:** A collection of my notes and insights from each session.
* **Projects:** Code implementations and projects developed during the course.
* **Hackathons:** Code submissions for both hackathons, with explanations.
